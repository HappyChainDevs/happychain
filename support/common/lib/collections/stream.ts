 * A simple stream implementation: producers can push values onto the stream,
 * while a consumer can wait on and consume the next incoming values from the stream.
 *
 * Consuming values is destructive: whenever {@link consume} is called (all the ways to consume eventually call
 * it), the value will no longer be available to other consumers (even if the value hasn't been produced yet).
 *
 * To safely consume the stream in multiple locations, you can call {@link fork} which creates
 * a new stream that will non-destructively receive all the values in the original stream. This
 * only applies to new values, not to the values that have already been buffered in the stream.
 * The source stream for a fork is called "the upstream". Closing the upstream closes the fork.
 *
 * Closing a stream causes a promise rejection with value {@link Stream.END}
 * to occur when calling {@link consume} and the values have run out.
