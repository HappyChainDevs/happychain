# @happy.tech/wallet-common

This is an unpublished package that gets rolled into [`@happy.tech/core`](../packages/core) and
[`@happy.tech/iframe`](../packages/iframe). It exists to hold definitions that are shared between the SDK and the
iframe.

This package relies on [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) (not HappyChain affiliated!) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for running tests.
