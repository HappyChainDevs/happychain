# @happychain/sdk-shared

This is an unpublished package that gets rolled into [`@happychain/js`](../packages/sdk-vanillajs)
[`happychain/sdk-react`](../packges/sdk-react) and [`@happychain/iframe`](../packages/iframe). It
exists to hold definitions that are shared between the SDK and the iframe.

This package relies on [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) (not HappyChain affiliated!) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for running tests.
