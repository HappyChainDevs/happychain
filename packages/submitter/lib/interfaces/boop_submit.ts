/**
 * POST `/api/v1/boop/submit`
 *
 * Given a Boop, sends it to the submitter which will either accept it and return its hash,
 * or fail with a rejection status.
 *
 * The submitter is nonce-aware and will buffer up to a certain amount of boop per nonce track,
 * depending on its configuration. It will submit boops whenever their nonces becomes eligible.
 *
 * The submitter will then attempt to submit the transaction onchain. The state of the Boop
 * can be queried with `submitter_state`.
 *
 * If the gas limits are provided, the submitter is free to perform or not perform simulation before
 * submitting.
 *
 * If the submitter already has a pending Boop with the same nonce for this account, it will
 * cancel the existing one on the condition that the new Boop passes validation. It can also
 * impose additional restrictions, such as requesting a higher submitterFee for the replacement
 * transaction.
 *
 * To cancel a pending Boop, simply call with an empty replacement transaction.
