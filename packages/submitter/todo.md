- rebase on new contracts
- fix tests
- build issue: don't use hono api stuff, explicit types

- inline the submitterClient
- submitter-client: explicit type user-facing
- don't throw errors in submit — integrate in SimulationResult
- have a boop state repository & don't otherwise cache simulationcache
- docs
- remove estimateGas in favour of simulation
- in submit/execute parallelize (1) fetch gas price & (2) simulate & (3) (maybe, see below) submitter wallet nonce
- use Viem nonce manager ?? does this save us roundtrip?
- genericity outside of happychain — start by just adding the chainID in the env
