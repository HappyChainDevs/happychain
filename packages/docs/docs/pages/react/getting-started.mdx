# Getting Started With React

## Install 
:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @happychain/react
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @happychain/react
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @happychain/react
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @happychain/react
```

:::

## Setup

After installing, the first thing you will need to do, is wrap your app in the `HappyWalletProvider`.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { HappyWalletProvider } from '@happychain/react' // [!code focus]
import App from './App.tsx'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <HappyWalletProvider> // [!code focus]
        <App />
    </HappyWalletProvider> // [!code focus]
)
```

## Usage

### Web3 Integration

Next you will want to setup your web3 integration using the `happyProvider`. 
The HappyProvider is an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) EVM provider. 
This means you can use it to initialize any standard web3 library as you normally would. 
The most common examples are below, but it should be fully compatible with most libraries.

:::code-group

```ts [Viem] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from '@happychain/react' 
// [!include ~/snippets/createClients.ts:viem]
```

```ts [Ethers] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from '@happychain/react'
// [!include ~/snippets/createClients.ts:ethers]
```


```ts [Web3.js] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from '@happychain/react'
// [!include ~/snippets/createClients.ts:web3]
```

### Getting the Active User

The `useHappyChain` hook returns the current user as a [HappyUser](/js/api-reference#happyuser)
if the user is connected, otherwise it returns undefined.

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react'
import { useHappyChain } from '@happychain/react'

function UserAddressComponent() {
    const { user } = useHappyChain()

    if (!user) {
        return <div>Not connected</div>
    }

    return <div>{user.address}</div>
}
```
