# Happy Wallet

The `<happy-wallet></happy-wallet>` component is a framework agnostic [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) which displays the users wallet and handles user connections.

Its required to be placed anywhere on your page, however its position is fixed, so exact placement in the DOM is not important.

## Manual Placement
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Your App</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@happychain/js@latest/umd/index.umd.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <happy-wallet></happy-wallet> // [!code focus]
  </body>
</html>
```

## Automatic Placement
Instead of placing manually, you may call the `register()` function to automatically inject it. This works better for some workflows.

```ts twoslash
import { register } from '@happychain/js'

register()
```
