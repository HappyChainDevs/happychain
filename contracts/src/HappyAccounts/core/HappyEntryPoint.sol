     * 1. Call the account to validate the happyTx.

     *    transaction, and charge it either to the paymaster (which can be the
     *    account itself) by calling its {@link IPaymaster#payout} function.
     *    The paymaster must pay this amount + the cost of the `payout` call.
     *
     * Gas estimation is then possible by doing an `eth_call` on this function
     * with `address(0)` as the sender (`tx.origin`) -â€” as this scenario is
     * impossible onchain. We call this "simulation mode".

     * In simulation mode, this function must ignore failed (but not
     * reverted) account and paymaster validation if their result is
     * the selector of {@link UnknownDuringSimulation} or

     *
     * Note that the function actually ignores the return value of `payout` as
     * long as the payment is effectively made.
     *
     * The function returns a filled-in {@link SubmitOutput} structure.
     * This is needed during simulation, as the logs are not available with
     * `eth_call`.
     *
     * NOTE: When `eth_simulateV1` (which does allow simple RPC log access)
     * becomes broadly available, the `SubmitOutput` structure can be removed
     * entirely, and the function doesn't need to return anything.
     * Also note that `debug_traceCall` is not an acceptable substitute, given
     * that it requires a custom tracer and that those are incompatible between
     * node implementations.
