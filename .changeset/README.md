# Changesets
## Intro
Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use
 - Run `make changeset` at the top level of the repo.
 - This enters an interactive CLI process, which asks which packages you would like to update
 - Select the appropriate semver update: major/minor/patch (likely patch)
 - Populate the update summary
 - Commit the resulting generated file in `.changeset/`. These files will be merged together at release time.
