/**
 * This stores the original version of all boops currently being processed by the submitter â€” from being received
 * on an endpoint to either (a) receiving the receipt (at which point the receipt, including the final version of
 * the boop, is stored into the database) or (b) answering all requests carrying the boop with an error status.
 *
 * Sponsored boops can have their gas limits and fees changed by the submitter and its
 * hash does not depend on these values, therefore there can be multiple "versions" of the boop with the same hash.
 *
 * Whenever these values are set as 0, the submitter fills them in. If they are not, the submitter
 * treats them as constraints to honor. We need to store the original version because we want to
 * keep honoring the original constraints in case the boop needs to be resubmitted onchain (e.g.
 * if the transaction gets stuck in the EVM mempool because of an insufficient EVM gas fee).
