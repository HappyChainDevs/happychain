# Boop SDK

The **Boop SDK** is an account abstraction toolkit built for speed, efficiency, and simplicity. 
It's an alternative to the 4337 spec, optimized for seamless transaction simulation and submission. 
While it thrives on HappyChain, it's fully chain-agnostic and ready to plug into any EVM-compatible 
network where the Boop Contracts are deployed.

## Installation

To install the Boop SDK in your project, use your preferred package manager:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Boop SDK:

```ts
import { simulate, submit } from "@happy.tech/boop-sdk"

// Simulate a transaction
const simulationResult = await simulate({/* Boop */})
console.log("Simulation Result:", simulationResult.unwrap())

// Submit the transaction
const txHash = await submit(simulationResult.unwrap())
console.log("Transaction Hash:", txHash.unwrap())
const boopReceipt = await receipt({ hash: txHash })
console.log("Boop Receipt:", boopReceipt.unwrap())

// or alternatively
const boopReceipt = await execute({/* Boop */})
console.log("Boop Receipt:", boopReceipt.unwrap())
```
