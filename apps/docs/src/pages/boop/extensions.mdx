# Boop Extensions

Boop supports two kind of extensions: validation extensions and execution extensions.

- Validation extensions are triggered at the account's discretion in the [`validate(Boop)`][account-overview] function.
  They enable permissioning certain operations differently. Validation extensions implement their own version of
  `validate(Boop)`, with the same signature and specification.

[account-overview]: /boop/contracts#account-contract

- Execution extensions are triggered at the account's discretion in the [`execute(Boop)`][account-overview] function.
  They enable customizing how certain operations are run. Execution extensions implement their own version of
  `execution(Boop)`, with the same signature and specification.

A typical account implementation like the [`HappyAccount`] will have a standard validation and execution path,
usually verifying some kind of signature for validation and carrying off the call specified in the boop's `dest`,
`callData` and `value` fields for execution. Extensions allow it to do different things in certain cases.

[`HappyAccount`]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/happychain/HappyAccount.sol

We currently maintain two extensions:

- The [`SessionKeyValidator`] enables account to authorize transactions to specific addresses to be signed by another EOA.
  We use this to implement [session keys] in the [Happy Wallet], enabling a user to authorize an app to make transactions on
  their behalf, but the principle can be using for any kind of simple delegation with a given target address as the singular criteria.

- The [`BatchCallExecutor`] enables batching multiple contract calls or transfers into a single Boop. It's the equivalent
  of a [multicall], but more powerful as the `msg.sender` on these calls will be account itself, just like for a normal
  Boop.

See the sections below on [using the `SessionKeyValidator`][using-session-key] and [using the
`BatchCallExecutor`][using-batch-call].

## Accepting Extensions

To support extensions, an account must implement [`IExtensibleAccount`] instead of [`IAccount`] (which the former extends).
See the [`HappyAccount`] for an example of this.

[`IExtensibleAccount`]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/interfaces/IExtensibleAccount.sol
[`IAccount`]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/interfaces/IAccount.sol

The interface adds a few functions to implement:

- `addExtension(address extension, ExtensionType type, bytes installData)`
- `removeExtension(address extension, ExtensionType type, bytes uninstallData)`
- `isExtensionRegistered(address extension, ExtensionType type)`
- `executeCallFromExecutor(CallInfo)`

The first three are pretty self-explanatory, this is how you add, remove and query extensions on the account. Each
extension has its own deployed contract. The `type` here is an enum that indicates whether the extension is an execution
or validation extension, and could be extended with other types in the future. If not empty, the data parameter is used
to make a call to the extension contract, which can be used for some install/uninstall bookkeeping, or to bundle
installation with initial usage. For instance, we use it to register an initial session key at the same time that we
install the session key extension.

Note that these first three functions can be called as boops themselves. Simply fire off a boop that makes
a call to the account itself, and don't forget the lock down who can call the function. The `HappyAccount` enables
them to be called as boops or from the owner EOA directly via the `onlySelfOrOwner` modifier.

The `executeCallFromExecutor` function enables execution extensions to make calls on behalf of the account (i.e.
`msg.sender` = account address). It must be locked down to only enable calls from an authorized executor, which we
recommend implementing via a `transient` variable set during the `execute` call. The [`CallInfo`][Types.sol] struct is just the usual
`dest`, `callData`, `value` triplet.

[Types.sol]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/interfaces/Types.sol

## Dispatching Extensions

How to know when to use an extension?

The account's [`validate` and `execute`][account-overview] functions can use any criteria they wants, however that would
have to be hardcoded in the logic.

The standard & recommended way to dispatch an extension is to use a reserved key in the boop's [`extraData`] dictionary.
The three-byte key `0x000001` ([`ICustomValidator.VALIDATOR_KEY`][`ICustomValidator`]) is reserved to specify the
address of a custom validator, while the three-byte key `0x000002` ([`ICustomExecutor.EXECUTOR_KEY`][`ICustomExecutor`])
is reserved to specify the address of a custom executor.

[`extraData`]: /boop/contracts#encoding
[`ICustomValidator`]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/interfaces/ICustomValidator.sol
[`ICustomExecutor`]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/contracts/src/boop/interfaces/ICustomExecutor.sol

During `validate` and `execute` respectively, the account should look up if these keys exist, and use the address to
make a call to the `validate` or `execute` function of the extension, respectively.

Of note, it's possible to specify garbled values for the reserved keys (i.e. not exactly 20 bytes) or addresses that are
not registered extensions. We provide the standard `InvalidExtensionValue` and `ExtensionNotRegistered` errors so that
`validate` and `execute` can reject these cases and aid debugging.

Again, see the [`HappyAccount`] for an example implementation.

## Implementing Extensions

Extension contracts themselves should implement the [`ICustomValidator`] or [`ICustomExecutor`] interfaces. These
interfaces are straightforward: they must respectively implement a `validate(Boop)` or `execute(Boop)` function, whose
signature and behaviour should be identical to the corresponding function in [the account itself][account-overview].

An execution extension can make calls on behalf of the account by calling `executeCallFromExecutor` on the account.

See the [`SessionKeyValidator`] and [`BatchCallExecutor`] extensions source code for implementation examples.

## Using the `SessionKeyValidator`

([Source code][`SessionKeyValidator`])

1. Install the session key validator on the account via `addExtension` on the account (can be sent as a boop).

2. Add a session key by calling `addSessionKey` on the session key validator contract, and passing it the address of the
   signing key and the authorized target address. This *must* be sent as a boop, as it registers the key for `msg.sender`.

3. You can now send boops with `dest` as the authorized target address. Specify the session key validator address as the
   value for `ICustomValidator.VALIDATOR_KEY` (`0x000001`). The account will use the session key contract to validate the
   call.

4. You can remove a session key by calling `removeSessionKey` on the validator, and you can uninstall the extension via
   `removeExtension` on the account.

You can use the Boop client SDK's [`encodeExtraData`] function to prepare the boop's [`extraData`] field.

[`encodeExtraData`]: /boop/sdk/api/functions/encodeExtraData

Note that if you use the [Happy Wallet] for [session keys], you don't need to worry about any of this: just use the
[`requestSessionKey`] function in our SDK, then send transactions to the authorized target address as usual, and the
Happy Wallet will automatically route them to use the registered session key.

[`requestSessionKey`]: sdk/js/api/functions/requestSessionKey

## Using the `BatchCallExecutor`

([Source code][`BatchCallExecutor`])

1. Install the session key validator on the account via `addExtension` on the account (can be sent as a boop).

2. You can now use the batch call executor by specifying the batch call executor address as the value for
   `ICustomExecutor.EXECUTOR_KEY` (`0x000001`) `extraData` key. The calls you want to make should be encoded as a tightly
   packed array of [`CallInfo`][Types.sol] structure (`address dest`, `uint256 value`, `bytes callData`) \*, and provided
   as the value for the ` BatchCallExecutor.BATCH_CALL_INFO_KEY` (`0x000100`) `extraData` key. The `dest`, `value` and
   `callData` fields of the boop itself are ignored and should be zeroed/empty.

   \* The memory layout for batching calls is: 20 bytes for the first destination, 32 bytes for the first value, 32 bytes
   for the calldata size of the first calldata, then the first calldata bytes, then repeat for the second batched call and
   onwards. The total length is encoded in the `extraData` key length.

   Note: in the future we may change the length of `CallInfo` size to be encoded on 3 bytes instead of 32, since the total
   length of an `extraData` key's value is encoded on 3 bytes anyway (allowing for up to 16MB values, which is more than a
   node will accept today anyway).

3. You can uninstall the extension via `removeExtension` on the account.

You can use the Boop client SDK's [`encodeExtraData`] function to prepare the boop's [`extraData`] field.
We will add a function to pack a `CallInfo` array shortly.

## Security Considerations

Extensions are extremely powerful. You should make sure you trust them before adding them to your account, as a
validator extension can essentially approve any boop on your account, while an executor extension can make any call it
wants on your behalf. Please make sure the extensions you use are trusted and review their code if you're able. If
you're not sure about an extension and don't want to lose control over your account and assets, don't install it!
