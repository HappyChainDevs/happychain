# The Boop Account Abstraction Stack

TODO picture

## What is account abstraction?

Account abstraction means making "the user account" a smart contract instead
of an "EOA" (Externally Owned Account, i.e. an account linked to private key).

Smart account come with many benefits:

- Security & recovery: the account specifies how its transactions are validated. The most common schema is
to use an EOA as the owner of the smart account. Using a smart account enables setting up mechanisms to
recover the account in case of key loss, as well as rotating the key in case it might have been compromised.

- Gas sponsorships & gas abstraction: smart accounts enable someone else to pay for the transaction fees
(gas sponsorship), or for someone to front the fees, to be repaid in a different token (gas abstraction).

- Better onboarding: it's possible to control a smart account via a
social account (Google etc) or a passkey instead of a traditional EOA. If more security
becomes needed, the mechanism can be changed later or supplemented with a recovery mechanism.

- Delegation and fine-grained permissions: smart accounts can delegate the authority of performing
transaction on their behalf to third-parties or to mechanisms with different security characteristics, on
the basis of validation logic in the account. Two mechanisms that enable this are session
keys (authorized other keys to perform select operations on your behalf) and subaccounts
(create secondary accounts authorized to draw some funds from the main account).

- Plug'n'play extensibility: as hinted above, you can extend your smart account with extra capabilities by installing
extensions that follow the smart account's extension standard.

... and a few drawbacks:

- Higher gas fees compared to EOAs.
- Immature wallet support. But it's fully supported by the [Happy Wallet](/sdk)!

## What is Boop?

Boop is an EVM account abstraction stack similar to ERC-4337 but with notable benefits and different trade-offs to it.

Boop's design choices prioritize three goals:

- Enable low-latency smart account execution.
- Keep the system as simple as possible without compromising on its power.
- Great user and developer experience.

To achieve this, it makes the following trade-offs (especially compared to ERC-4337):

- The gas cost is slightly higher.
- There are less restrictions aimed at preventing infrastructure operators from taking
losses. In practice, both ERC-4337 and Boop need to rely on reputation heuristics
— we just systematize this and make the system simpler in the process.

Here are a few highlights of where Boop shines:

- Users can send a sponsored transaction in a single network call (no
  need to pre-simulate, fetch gas fees, hit up a paymaster service, ...).

- The latency is vastly better, leading to ~2.2s send to confirmed latency on average
  on a 2s-block blockchain compared to ~7s with ERC-4337 in the same latency conditions. About 1.2s of this due to
  the average time to wait for a new block, meaning that the ratio improves in Boop's favour as block time get lower.

- We don't require users to keep a separate balance to pay for transaction fees ("staking"), avoiding fragmentation.

- Our code is simpler, smaller, and much more pleasant to read than the alternative.
  This means that if Boop doesn't do exactly what you want, it is easy to fork & tweak.
  The contracts and the supporting infrastructure was developed in concert.

- Our extension system is much better than ERC-4337 — we actually specify things for one, meaning that extensions
  can be compatible between multiple account implementations.

- Top-notch documentation ✨

## What about EIP-7702?

EIP-7702 is a standard that enables EOA to be upgraded to smart accounts.

Boop should be fully compatible with EIP-7702 — it should be as
simple as delegating your EOA to a Boop account implementation.

That being said, we haven't yet done the needful to verify
that this works — reach out at hello@happy.tech if interested!

## Who's building this? Is this open-source?

The Boop stack is designed and maintained by Happy Devs, a team
that works on infrastructure for the HappyChain blockchain.

Happy Devs also builds the Happy Wallet, which is powered by the Boop stack.

Boop itself is open-source under the BSD license, it's free to use, modify and redistribute
in all cases. You just can't use our brand names (Happy Devs, HappyChain) to promote
your work. We accept no liability for your use of the work, and you can't sue us ;)
