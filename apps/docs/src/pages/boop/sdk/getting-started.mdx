# Getting started with the Boop SDK

The **Boop SDK** is a TypeScript library for interaction with the Boop account abstraction stack.

Boop is an account abstraction stack built for speed, efficiency, and simplicity.
It's an alternative to the ERC-4337 spec, optimized for low-latency end-to-end transaction processing.

While it thrives on HappyChain, it's fully chain-agnostic and ready to plug into any EVM-compatible
network where the Boop Contracts are deployed.

## Install

### Using a package manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @happy.tech/boop-sdk
```

:::

## Setup

### Instantiate the SDK

The first thing you will need to do is create a new [BoopClient](/boop/sdk/api/classes/BoopClient).
```ts twoslash
import { BoopClient } from "@happy.tech/boop-sdk"

const boopClient = new BoopClient()
```

## Usage

Once a [`BoopClient`](/boop/sdk/getting-started#instantiate-the-sdk) has been created,
the next thing you will likely want to do is determine the HappyAccount address of the user. 
This can be accomplished with [`createAccount`](/boop/sdk/api/classes/BoopClient#createaccount)

### Create an account

```tsx
const result = await boopClient.createAccount({
    owner: '0x123', // The address of the user
    salt: '0x1', // A unique salt for the user
})

if (result.status === CreateAccount.Success) {
    console.log(`Account created: ${result.account}`)
} else if (result.status === CreateAccount.AlreadyCreated) {
    console.log(`Account already existed: ${result.account}`)
} else {
    console.log(`Account creation failed: ${result.description}`)
}
```

### Submit a Boop
Once you have the account address, you can submit a Boop to the network. There are two ways to 
accomplish this. 

The first is to use the [execute](/boop/sdk/api/classes/BoopClient#execute) method. This will submit 
the boop, and wait for the receipt to confirm onchain inclusion. 

```ts
const boop: Boop = { /* BoopData */ }
const receipt = await boopClient.execute({ boop })
console.log(receipt.status) 
```

The second is to use the [submit](/boop/sdk/api/classes/BoopClient#submit) method.
This will return quickly with the boop hash. Following successful submission, its recommended to 
wait for the receipt to confirm onchain inclusion. . Note that calling `waitForReceipt` before `submit` returns **will not work**.

```ts
const boop: Boop = { /* BoopData */}
const result = await boopClient.submit({ boop })
if (result.status !== Submit.Success) throw new Error(result.description)
const receipt = await boopClient.waitForReceipt({ boopHash: result.boopHash })
```
