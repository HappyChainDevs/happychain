# Boop Submitter

Please checkout the [Submitter Overview](/boop/architecture#submitter-overview) of the Architecture page for background information.

As a reminder, the role of the submitter is to make EVM transaction to send boops to the chain, either sponsoring fees,
or fronting them, to be repaid by the account or by a paymaster contract.

The submitter implementation maintained by Happy Devs exposes the following endpoints, see the [overview] for a short
description and the [REST API reference](/boop/rest) for a full specification.

- `/api/v1/accounts/create`
- `/api/v1/boop/simulate`
- `/api/v1/boop/submit`
- `/api/v1/boop/waitForReceipt`
- `/api/v1/boop/execute`
- `/api/v1/boop/getState`
- `/api/v1/boop/getPending`

## Boop Lifecycle

When the submitter receives a boop for onchain submission (`submit` or `execute`), the boop goes through the following
stages:

1. First, the boop is simulated. If the results indicates it is ready for submission, it will move to that stage
   immediately.

2. Otherwise, if the only issue with the boop is that its nonce is not current with the latest block, we will check to
   see if we have already submitted the preceding boops. If so, we can proceed with submission, otherwise we wait until
   that is the case or a timeout occurs. In those cases, we say the boop is "blocked".

   If the boop is not ready for submission for other reasons, an error is returned to the user.

3. We submit the boop to the chain, then move to wait for the receipt. We say that the boop is "pending" — this is an
   internal term, i.e. `getPending` returns both boops that are "blocked" and "pending", as well as those that are in
   between these two states.

   If the `submit` endpoint invoked was submit, we return the [boop hash] to the user at this stage. If it was `execute`,
   we keep waiting.

   Depending on its configuration, the submitter may attempt to resubmit the boop if it's not included fast enough. It will
   resimulate before doing this, and if the boop is sponsored, it will also update its fees (while keeping the same [boop
   hash]).

4. We wait for the receipt to come in. A few things can happen here:

    1. The boop executes successfully, and we return a successful receipt to the user.

    2. The boop is included onchain, but does not succeed. This can happen if the call specified by the boop reverts.
       In those cases, fees are still paid, and the account nonce is incremented. We return a failed receipt to the user.

    3. The EVM call made by the submitter to submit the boop is included onchain but reverts. If the submitter
       implementation is correct, this is not supposed to happen and indicates faulty or malicious account or paymaster
       implementations. An error is returned to the user, and the submitter will record the problem and act on it according to
       its policies (see the [Griefing Protection](#griefing-protection) section below).

    4. The submitter internal timeout for the receipt triggers, and moves towards cancelling its EVM transacton (which it
       needs to do to unblock the EOA that submitted the boop). We return an error to the user, but it's still technically
       possible for the boop to be included onchain (scenarios 1 & 2). A further call to `getState` or `waitForReceipt` can be
       used to ascertain if the boop might still land onchain.

    5. The operation's timeout triggers while waiting for the receipt. Depending on submitter configuration, all the
       other scenarios might still be possible, but the user will only see a timeout error. Same remedy as in scenario (3).

Of course, many of these things can fail, in which the user also gets an error back.

As you can see, receipts work essentially the same ways as they do for transactions on the EVM: a receipt is emitted if
the boop lands onchain, regardless of whether it is successful or not. A receipt is however not emitted if the EVM
transaction carrying it lands onchain but fails itself.

## The Submitter as Boop Indexer

Boop are identified by their [boop hash]. You cannot query a blockchain nodes about boops directly — you need to query
the submitter via `getState` or `waitForReceipt`.

Our submitter implementation saves all the receipts of the boops it submits itself.

It should be very rare, but it's currently possible for the submitter to "lose" a receipt, if it moves to cancel a
transaction sending a boop, but it gets included onchain anyway. We will fix this shortly.

## Running & Configuring the Submitter

See the [github repo][submitter-package] on how to get started running the submitter.

[submitter-package]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/tree/master/apps/submitter

The submitter comes with a plethora of configuration options which are controlled via environment variable (which you can
defined in the submitter's `.env` file), which are specified in the following schemas:

- [App] — configure keys, output, external services (traces & metrics), ...
- [Deployment] — configure chain & contracts to use
- [Limits] — configure maximum for user specified timeouts, capacity limits, max cache sizes, ...
- [Tuning] — configure timeouts, delays, retries, ...
- [Gas] — configure parameters related to gas limits & fees

[App]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/apps/submitter/lib/env/schemas/app.ts
[Deployment]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/apps/submitter/lib/env/schemas/deployment.ts
[Limits]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/apps/submitter/lib/env/schemas/limits.ts
[Tuning]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/blob/master/apps/submitter/lib/env/schemas/tuning.ts

## Griefing Protection

Because the submitter fronts the blockchain fees for boops, it is vulnerable to griefing from malicious parties.

## Malicious Invalidations

The most problematic form of griefing is when a malicious account or paymaster can validate successfully during
simulation but revert during onchain execution — for account this also extends to payment. This causes the transaction
to be included onchain and fees to be charged to the submitter, but because of the rejected validation, no fees are paid
back to it.

To protect themselves against these attacks, submitters have a few options:

1. Only limit themselves to known account implementations. This can only be achieved with the use of an account registry,
  as described in the section on [Accout Deployment] of the Architecture page. Note that this registry does not
  necessarily need to live onchain. Also note that allowing arbitrary validator extension invalidate this protection, and
  they must be similarly vetted.

[Account Deployment]: /boop/architecture#account-deployment

2. Adopt an out-of-protocol staking system that the submitter can use to compensate its losses from misbehaving accounts
   or paymasters.

3. Adopt a reputation system where they refuse to serve accounts or paymasters that have reached a set quota of
  misbehaviour. This is ultimately not foolproof as it's always possible to deploy new accounts and paymasters, but such a
  system at least guarantee a minimum cost to the attacker. The implementation has [policy code][policies] that can be tweaked to
  deal with this.

[policies]: https://github.com/HappyChainDevs/happychain/tree/master/apps/submitter/lib/policies

4. Rate limit the number of boops and gas in flight per account, and the total amount of boops and gas in flight. While
   not a solution by itself, this bounds losses per unit of time. This is highly complementary with (3).

We believe that option (1) is likely to be the dominant one, where submitters serve the accounts they deployed on behalf
of their users, or their clients' users.

Only options (1) and (2), the most restrictive, offer a complete solution. The combination of options (3) and (4)
probably provide adequate protection on a low-fee blockchain.

Note that we do not consider the measure outlined in [EIP-7562], which consists of restriction the state the account and
paymaster validation is allowed to touch. This is because the Boop system makes it trivial (for its own benefit) to
differentiate between simulation and actual execution by checking `tx.origin`. [EIP-7562]: https://eip.tools/eip/7562

## Other forms of griefing

If an account or paymaster lacks funds to pay for a boop's fees, this will be caught during simulation. If these
balances were to change between simulation and execution, the check arrives relatively early during onchain execution,
limiting sequencer loss. The misbehaviour can then be reported and handled via [custom policies][policies].

Paymasters are required to "stake" (deposit) funds with the entry point for a certain duration. These funds are used to
pay the submitter. The submitter can monitor the remaining stake amount and duration and refuse to service paymaster
when these values fall below a certain threshold. This is a planned feature in our submitter.
