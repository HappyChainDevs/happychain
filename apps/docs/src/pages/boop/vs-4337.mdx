# Boop vs ERC-4337

Here's a short comparison of Boop and ERC-4337 strength and weaknesses.

Note: smart account transactions are called "boops" in the Boop stack, and "user operations" (or "user ops") in
ERC-4337, but we use the term "transaction" here.

- Latency
    - Simulation
        - bles really low latency by enabling the submitter to set the fees and gas limits for transactions it sponsors
          itself, and for transactions sponsored by paymasters (who need to validate that these values are set adequately). For
          instance, this means that for signature validation, account owner don't need to set the fee values and gas limits.
        - ERC-4337 requires additional network calls and at least one additional network roundtrip to fetch these values.
    - Paymaster
        - Boop encourages the use of onchain paymasters to avoid an additional roundtrip to a signing paymaster service,
          whereas that is the standard for sponsoring paymasters in ERC-4337 — which is still capable of also handling
          fully onchain paymasters.
        - Boop enables submitters to sponsor transactions, whereas this is not possible for ERC-4337 bundlers.
          In practice, most apps using ERC-4337 pick a single provider for their bundler and paymasters. Sponsoring
          submitters save gas compared to using a paymaster.
- Balance Fragmentation
    - Boop does not require users to stake with the entry point contracts to pay for transaction fees for non-sponsored
      transactions, whereas ERC-4337 does.
    - Both Boop and ERC-4337 require paymasters to stake with the entry point.
- Complexity
    - ERC-4337's contracts are much more complex than the Boop contracts.
      This is subjective, but form your own opinion: [Boop contracts], [ERC-4337 contracts]
- Extensions
    - Boop has a well-specified and simple [extension system].
    - ERC-4337 has two competing extension systems ([ERC-7579], [ERC-6900]) the most popular of which (7579) is poorly
      specified, and has multiple incompatible vendor implementations.
- Adoption
    - Boop just came out.
    - ERC-4337 is fairly widely adopted.
- Audits
    - ERC-4337 contracts have been audited by OpenZeppelin.
    - Boop has not been audited yet.
- Wallet Support
    - Wallet for support ERC-4337 is relatively spotty — [Ambire] as seemingly the only "real" wallet (i.e. not
      tied to single app) you can could use, but things to be changing starting with [MetaMask].
    - The [Happy Wallet] is powered by Boop, but only runs on the HappyChain testnet today.
- Gas Costs
    - Boop is marginally cheaper than most ERC-4337 contract implementations on a 1-1 basis. But see "Transaction Bundling"
      for extra considerations.
- Transaction Bundling
    - ERC-4337 supports bundling transactions accross multiple accounts.
    - Boop contracts suports bundling transactions accross accounts too (it needs to special provisions to do this),
      however the [submitter] is not set up to support bundling.
    - Boop supports bundling transactions for the same account via the [`BatchCallExecutor`] extension.
    - When using bundling in ERC-4337 and no bundling in Boop, ERC-4337 will be marginally cheaper in terms of gas
      per transaction.
- Griefing Protection
    - Boop offers less griefing protection than ERC-4337 — this is unavoidable to avoid user balance fragmentation
      (see above). In practice, permissioning account implementations solves the issues, and reputation heuristics
      are fine in low-fee environments.
    - ERC-4337 outlines a complex set of griefing protection measures in [ERC-7562], but not all major bundlers implement
      them. They can't fully prevent griefing, but can offer more downside protection than possible with Boop.
- Mempool
    - Boop does not ship mempool logic. It is less well-suited for an open mempool in particular because of griefing
      protection concerns. Setting up up a private mempool is not too complicated but not implemented.
    - One of ERC-4337's goal is the establishment of a fully open shared mempool, and this is implemented in a number
      of ERC-4337 bundlers — but it's almost impossible to find how to set it up without spelunking source code.
- [EIP-7702]
    - ERC-4337 with EntryPoint v0.8 is fully compatible with EIP-7702.
    - Boop should in principle be fully compatible with EIP-7702, but this hasn't been verified via an actual deployment.
- Account Deployment
    - In ERC-4337, accounts must be deployed by the EntryPoint, at the same time as the first transaction is made.
        - Account deployment factories must be staked with the EntryPoint.
    - In Boop, [account deployment][deployment] is not specified in-protocol. They can be deployed in advance, or at
      the same time as the first transaction via a [multicall].
- Explorer Support
    - Many block explorers support ERC-4337.
    - Boop does not yet have block explorer support but the [`BoopSubmitted` event][event] makes boop information visible in
      EVM event logs on existing block explorers.
