## Type declaration

### abis

```ts
abis: Record<string, Abi>;
```

The ABIs used by the TransactionManager.
This is a record of aliases to ABIs. The aliases are used to reference the ABIs in the
transactions.

### baseFeePercentageMargin?

```ts
optional baseFeePercentageMargin: bigint;
```

Safety margin for transaction base fees, expressed as a percentage.
For example, a 20% increase should be represented as 20n.

This is used to calculate the maximum fee per gas and safeguard from unanticipated or
unpredictable gas price increases, in particular when the transaction cannot be included in
the very next block.

If not provided, defaults to 20n (20% increase).

### blockTime?

```ts
optional blockTime: bigint;
```

The expected interval (in seconds) for the creation of a new block on the blockchain.
Defaults to 2 seconds.

### chainId

```ts
chainId: number;
```

The chain ID of the blockchain.

### eip1559?

```ts
optional eip1559: EIP1559Parameters;
```

Optional EIP-1559 parameters. If not provided, defaults to the OP stack's stock parameters.

### finalizedTransactionPurgeTime?

```ts
optional finalizedTransactionPurgeTime: number;
```

The time (in milliseconds) after which finalized transactions are purged from the database.
If finalizedTransactionPurgeTime is 0, finalized transactions are not purged from the database.
Defaults to 2 minutes.

### gasEstimator?

```ts
optional gasEstimator: GasEstimator;
```

The gas estimator to use for estimating the gas limit of a transaction.
You can provide your own implementation to override the default one.
Default: [DefaultGasLimitEstimator](/txm/api/classes/DefaultGasLimitEstimator)

### maxPriorityFeePerGas?

```ts
optional maxPriorityFeePerGas: bigint;
```

Optional maximum priority fee per gas.
This is the maximum amount of wei per gas the transaction is willing to pay as a tip to miners.
If not provided, defaults to 0n.

### privateKey

```ts
privateKey: Hex;
```

The private key of the account used for signing transactions.

### retryPolicyManager?

```ts
optional retryPolicyManager: RetryPolicyManager;
```

The retry policy manager to use for retrying failed transactions.
You can provide your own implementation to override the default one.
This is used to determine if a transaction should be retried based on the receipt of the transaction when it reverts.
Default: DefaultRetryPolicyManager

### rpc

```ts
{
  allowDebug: boolean;
  retries: number;
  retryDelay: number;
  timeout: number;
  url: string;
}
```

The RPC node configuration
