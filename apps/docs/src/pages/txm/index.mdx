⚠️️⚠️⚠️ **TXM is not yet available — these docs just offer a preview of what is to come.** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

TXM is a robust blockchain transaction management library.

Managing transactions on the blockchain can be a complex endeavor, as it requires careful consideration of various factors, including:

- Reverted transactions
- Insufficient gas price
- Incorrect nonce values
- Inaccurate gas prices
- Improper gas limits
- Transactions lost in the mempool
- And more

To address these challenges, we developed the HappyChain Transaction Manager. This library enables you to effortlessly send transactions to the blockchain without worrying about the aforementioned issues.
