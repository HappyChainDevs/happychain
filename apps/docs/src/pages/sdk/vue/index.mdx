# Getting Started With Vue

The `@happy.tech/vue` package provides Vue-specific functionality, to be used instead or in
addition to those provided in [`@happy.tech/core`][js-getting-started].

You should read the [`@happy.tech/core` docs][js-getting-started] for important context!

[js-getting-started]: /sdk/js


## Install 

### Using a package manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @happy.tech/core @happy.tech/vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @happy.tech/core @happy.tech/vue
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @happy.tech/core @happy.tech/vue
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @happy.tech/core @happy.tech/vue
```

:::

## Setup

After installing, you will need to initialize the `HappyChainPlugin`.

```tsx
import { HappyChainPlugin } from "@happy.tech/vue"
import { createApp } from "vue"
import App from "./App.vue"

createApp(App)
    .use(HappyChainPlugin)
    .mount("#app")
```

## Usage

### Getting the active user

The `useHappyWallet` composable returns the current authenticated user's data as 
[HappyUser](/sdk/js/api/type-aliases/HappyUser), or `undefined` when no user is connected.

```vue twoslash
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useHappyWallet } from "@happy.tech/vue"
const { user } = useHappyWallet()
</script>

<template>
<div v-if="user"> 
    <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
    <h2>{{ user.address}}</h2>
    <img :src="user.avatar" />
</div>
</template>
```
