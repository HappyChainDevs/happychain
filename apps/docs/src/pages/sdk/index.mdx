# Happy Wallet SDK

The Happy Wallet is an embedded wallet that lets user log in with their social accounts (web3 wallets are
also supported), enables gas sponsorship (1), and allows apps to make transactions without the user having to confirm them
via [session keys].

Please see the [Getting Started] page for a full overview of how to integrate and interact with the
wallet.

[Getting Started]: /sdk/js/getting-started
[session keys]: /sdk/js/getting-started#session-keys

(1) Each user gets a daily gas budget that streams back over time. On the HappyChain Sepolia
testnet, this budget is quite large. Once the user runs out of budget, he must pay for the gas
himself, or an app must sponsor (not implemented yet).
