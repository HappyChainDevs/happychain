# Getting started with JavaScript/TypeScript

The `@happy.tech/core` package provides the base functionality, to be used in isolation or to 
support a framework specific package such as [`@happy.tech/react`][react-getting-started] or [`@happy.tech/vue`][vue-getting-started].

[react-getting-started]: /sdk/react
[vue-getting-started]: /sdk/vue


## Install

### Using a package manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @happy.tech/core
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @happy.tech/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @happy.tech/core
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @happy.tech/core
```

:::

{/*
### Using a CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@happy.tech/core@latest/umd/index.umd.js"></script>
```
*/}

## Setup 

### Wallet component

Once you have installed the SDK, you will need to register the wallet component on the page. 
The easiest way to acomplish this is by using our provided [`register`] method.

[`register`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/register

```ts twoslash
import { loadHappyWallet } from "@happy.tech/core"

loadHappyWallet()
```

## Usage

### Web3 Integration (Viem, Wagmi, Ethers, ...)

Next you will want to set up your web3 integration using the [`happyProvider`].
The HappyProvider is an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) EVM provider. 
This means you can use it to initialize any standard web3 library as you normally would. 
The most common examples are below, but it should be fully compatible with most libraries.

[`happyProvider`]: /sdk/js/api/variables/happyProvider

:::code-group

```ts [Vanilla] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from "@happy.tech/core"
happyProvider.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" }) // [!code focus]
```

```ts [Viem] twoslash
import { createHappyPublicClient, createHappyWalletClient } from "@happy.tech/core"

const publicClient = createHappyPublicClient() // [!code focus:2]
const walletClient = createHappyWalletClient()
```

```ts [Wagmi] twoslash
import { createHappyChainWagmiConfig, happyChainSepolia } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { connect } from "@wagmi/core"

const config = createHappyChainWagmiConfig(happyChainSepolia)// [!code focus:2]
const result = await connect(config, {connector: config.connectors[0]})
```

```ts [Ethers] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { BrowserProvider } from "ethers"

const ethersProvider = new BrowserProvider(happyProvider) // [!code focus]
```

```ts [Viem (custom)] twoslash
import { happyProvider } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, custom } from "viem"

const transport = custom(happyProvider) // [!code focus:9]
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport,
    // ... your custom options (https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public)
})
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
    transport,
    // ... your custom options (https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet)
})
 ```

```ts [Wagmi (custom)] twoslash
import { happyChainSepolia, happyProvider } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { happyWagmiConnector } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { connect, createConfig, custom } from "@wagmi/core"

const connector = happyWagmiConnector() // [!code focus:10]
const config = createConfig({
        chains: [happyChainSepolia],
        connectors: [connector],
        multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: false,
        transports: {
            [happyChainSepolia.id]: custom(happyProvider),
        },
    })
const result = await connect(config, { connector })
```

### Connection

You can call [`connect()`] to prompt the user to connect the wallet to the app. This will also prompt the user to log in
to the wallet if he hasn't already.

[`connect()`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/connect

The wallet is also capable of "lazy connection": if you make any request that requires the user to be connected (like
trying to send a transaction), then the wallet will automatically prompt the user to do so.

### Getting the active user

User changes, such as when a user logs in or out, can be subscribed to the [`onUserUpdate`] listener.
If the `user` is undefined, then they are not currently logged in have or have logged out. 
If the `user` is a [HappyUser](/sdk/js/api/type-aliases/HappyUser) then it will be populated with all their 
shared info, such as wallet address and name.

[`onUserUpdate`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/onUserUpdate

```ts twoslash
import { onUserUpdate } from "@happy.tech/core"

// [!include ~/snippets/listeners.ts:onUserUpdate]
```

Alternatively, the current user is always exposed via the [`getCurrentUser`] call.

[`getCurrentUser`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/getCurrentUser

```ts twoslash
import { getCurrentUser } from "@happy.tech/core"

// [!include ~/snippets/listeners.ts:getCurrentUser]
```

[`onUserUpdate`] only fires whenever the user changes, so if you want to have something depend on the
current user, you should write your code as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { type HappyUser, getCurrentUser, onUserUpdate } from "@happy.tech/core"

// [!include ~/snippets/listeners.ts:getCurrentUserExample]
```

### Interacting with the wallet

The SDK makes the following functions available for wallet interaction:

- [`connect()`] — Prompts the user to connect the wallet to the app.
    - This will also prompt the user to log in to the wallet if he hasn't already.

<Button onClick={connect}>{(() => { 
    const {user} = useHappyWallet()
    return user?.address ? `Already Connected!` : "Connect Wallet"
})()}</Button>

- [`disconnect()`] — Disconnects the wallet from the app.
    - The user will stay logged in.

<Button onClick={disconnect}>{(() => { 
    const {user} = useHappyWallet()
    return user?.address ? `Disconnect` : "Must Connect First!"
})()}</Button>

- [`openWallet()`] — Pops the wallet open.

<Button onClick={openWallet}>Open Wallet</Button>

- [`loadAbi(abi: Abi)`] — Prompts the user to approve the ABI, which is then used to decode
  transactions in approval popups.

<Button onClick={() => loadAbi(deployment.MockTokenA, abis.MockTokenA)}>
    Load ABI
</Button>

[`disconnect()`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/disconnect
[`openWallet()`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/openWallet
[`loadAbi(abi: Abi)`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/loadAbi

{/* NOTE — not documenting `showSendScreen` as we might want to deprecate that function. */}

### Session Keys

You can call [`requestSessionKey(contract: Address)`] to prompt the user to approve a session key
authorizing the app to transact with the selected contract on the user's behalf.

[`requestSessionKey(contract: Address)`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/requestSessionKey

<Button onClick={() => requestSessionKey(deployment.MockTokenA).then(() => alert('Session Key Added!'))}>
    Request Session Key
</Button>

The session key is persisted between session, and further calls to the function simply return without
prompting the user, so it is safe to always call this function before other actions.

```ts twoslash
import { createHappyWalletClient, requestSessionKey } from "@happy.tech/core"
import { parseAbi, type Hash } from "viem"

const walletClient = createHappyWalletClient() // [!code focus:2]
const counterContract = "0xeAe5825cd598FD74ffa199b6849b2286eb8405Ca" as const

async function noApproveTx(): Promise<Hash> {
    await requestSessionKey(counterContract) // [!code focus:6]
    return await walletClient.writeContract({
        address: "0xeAe5825cd598FD74ffa199b6849b2286eb8405Ca",
        abi: parseAbi(["function increment()"]),
        functionName: "increment",
    })
}
```

What happens under the hood? When a session key is approved, the wallet creates a key and saves it in the wallet's local
storage. The session key's address is registered with the user's wallet onchain. The key itself never leaves the wallet,
so apps cannot access it. However, browser extensions could access them by injecting content scripts into the page.

The user can revoke session keys in the wallet settings, under "Permissions", while the app can revoke them using the
[`revokeSessionKey`] function.

[`revokeSessionKey`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/revokeSessionKey

### UI component

<ConnectButton />
<br />

The Happy Wallet component (the orb on the right side of the screen that opens up the wallet)
is automatically added to the page when you call [`loadHappyWallet`].

To display a connection button, you can use the `happychain-connect-button` [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
The button turns into a badge displaying the username and avatar after connecting.

If you would like to customize the look, the default styles can be completely disabled by setting 
`disableStyles` to true in [`loadHappyWallet`] and defining your own styles using regular CSS.

[`loadHappyWallet`]: /sdk/js/api/functions/loadHappyWallet

```html twoslash
<happychain-connect-button></happychain-connect-button>
```

### Chain Information

The package exports the HappyChain chain information in Viem format. This includes the chain ID, RPC
& explorer URLs, addresses of key contracts, and more.

- [`happychainSepolia`](/sdk/js/api/variables/happyChainSepolia)

```ts [twoslash]
import { happyChainSepolia } from "@happy.tech/core"

console.log(`HappyChain Sepolia's chain ID is ${happyChainSepolia.id}`)
```
