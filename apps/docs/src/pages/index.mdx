# HappyChain Docs ðŸ¤ 

[HappyChain] is a blockchain focused on onchain games and social apps.
We help solve challenges in building and distributing these demanding applications.

Applications on HappyChain use the [Happy Wallet] to onboard users in seconds:

- No need to install anything â€” the wallet is embedded in your app
- No need to secure a seed phrase â€” users can log in with their social account (the wallet remains noncustodial)
- No need to pay for gas â€” via gas sponsorship, so no need to bridge funds to start playing

The HappyWallet also supports [session keys], enabling your app to sign transaction on the users
behalf (no more confirmation popups) after the user approves a session key for a given contract.

HappyChain is a layer 2 blockchain that settles to Ethereum, with Celestia underneath for data
availability.

You can learn more about [what HappyChain is][happy-beginnings] and [our vision][conjuring-creation]

## Infrastructure

These are open-source tools and utilities that we build for our internal needs
but make available to everyone. App builders most likely won't need those.

## Incubating

Stuff that's not quite ready yet, but you preview :)

- [TXM (Transaction Manager)] â€” Our WIP transaction manager, which makes submitting transactions super reliable
and takes care of everything that could go wrong. It also allows custom fine-grained policies for
handling issues in the transaction lifecycle.
