# HappyChain Documentation Hub

[HappyChain] is a blockchain focused on onchain games and social apps.
We help solve challenges in building and distributing these demanding applications.

Applications on HappyChain use the [Happy Wallet] to onboard users in seconds:

- No need to install anything — the wallet is embedded in your app
- No need to secure a seed phrase — users can log in with their social account (the wallet remains noncustodial)
- No need to pay for gas — via gas sponsorship, so no need to bridge funds to start playing

The HappyWallet also supports [session keys], enabling your app to sign transaction on the users
behalf (no more confirmation popups) after the user approves a session key for a given contract.

HappyChain is a layer 2 blockchain that settles to Ethereum, with Celestia underneath for data
availability.

You can learn more about [what HappyChain is][happy-beginnings] and [our vision][conjuring-creation]
on [our Mirror blog][mirror].

## For App Devs

- [Chain Information] — Handy information & links to work with HappyChain (chain ID, RPC servers, block explorer, faucet, ...)
- [Happy Wallet SDK] — How to integrate the Happy Wallet in your application — it's dead easy.

## Infrastructure

These are open-source tools and utilities that we build for our internal needs
but make available to everyone. App builders most likely won't need those.

Our [Boop account abstraction stack](/boop) provides all the convenience of account abstraction (key rotation &
recovery, gas sponsorship & gas abstraction, delegation & session keys, extensibility) in a software form-factor
that enables low latency blockchain interactions, implementation simplicity, and superb reliability.

We maintain all sides of the stack: [contracts](/boop/contracts), [submitter](/boop/submitter) (relaying transactions &
more), and a [client-side SDK](/boop/sdk) for easy interactions with the stack from JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Incubating

Stuff that's not quite ready yet, but for you to preview :)

- [TXM (Transaction Manager)](/txm) — Our WIP transaction manager, which makes submitting transactions super reliable
and takes care of everything that could go wrong. It also allows custom fine-grained policies for handling issues in the
transaction lifecycle. TXM is already running on HappyChain Sepolia, where it is the backbone of our randomness
solution.

- **Happy Randomness** — Our unique <abbr title="Verifiable Random Function">VRF</abbr> solution to provisioning provable
  onchain randomness, built on top of [TXM](/txm) and the [Drand network][drand]. Besides the traditional request-response
  model, Happy Randomness uniquely provides "synchronous randomness" — provable random numbers by making a contract call.
  Documentation coming soon.
