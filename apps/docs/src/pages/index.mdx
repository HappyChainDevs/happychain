# HappyChain Docs ðŸ¤ 

[HappyChain] is a blockchain focused on onchain games and social apps.
We help solve challenges in building and distributing these demanding applications.

Applications on HappyChain use the [Happy Wallet] to onboard users in seconds:

- No need to install anything â€” the wallet is embedded in your app
- No need to secure a seed phrase â€” users can log in with their social account (the wallet remains noncustodial)
- No need to pay for gas â€” via gas sponsorship, so no need to bridge funds to start playing

The HappyWallet also supports [session keys], enabling your app to sign transaction on the users
behalf (no more confirmation popups) after the user approves a session key for a given contract.

HappyChain is a layer 2 blockchain that settles to Ethereum, with Celestia underneath for data
availability.
