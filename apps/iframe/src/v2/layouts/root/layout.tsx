/**
 * Layout common to all pages.
 * Uses an "islands" architecture, where distinct interactive areas are visually and functionally 
 * separated from the main content.
 * 
 * We have 2 key islands in our layout :
 * 
 * 1. Device.ActionsIsland:
 *    - Located inside <Device /> but outside its <Screen /> 
 *    - Contains contextual actions that change based on current screen
 * 
 * 2. Screen.View.BottomNavbarIsland:
 *    - Represents software navigation within the digital interface
 *    - Located inside <Screen.View /> (part of the digital display)
 *    - Appears and behaves like a traditional mobile app navbar

 * @note Nesting order matters - Root (state) > Device (hardware) > Screen (display) > View (page/screen)
 * @note Children are rendered within `<Screen.View />`, not directly in Device or Screen
 * @note Page-specific controls should be handled by exporting custom components 
 *       that ActionsIsland and BottomNavbarIsland can render conditionally
